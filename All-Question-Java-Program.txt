Question-1
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Your local library needs your help! Given the expected and actual return dates for a library book, create a program that calculates the fine (if any). The fee structure is as follows:

If the book is returned on or before the expected return date, no fine will be charged (i.e.: fine=0).
If the book is returned after the expected return day but still within the same calendar month and year as the expected return date, fine=15*(no of days late).
If the book is returned after the expected return month but still within the same calendar year as the expected return date, the fine=500*(not of months late) .
If the book is returned after the calendar year in which it was expected, there is a fixed fine of 10000.

Input Format:
The first line contains  space-separated integers denoting the respective day, month, and year on which the book was actually returned.
The second line contains  space-separated integers denoting the respective day, month, and year on which the book was expected to be returned (due date).

Output Format
Print a single integer denoting the library fine for the book received as input.

Question-2
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Read a string, S, and print its integer value; if  cannot be converted to an integer, print Bad String.

Note: You must use the String-to-Integer and exception handling constructs built into your submission language. If you attempt to use loops/conditional statements, you will get a  score.
